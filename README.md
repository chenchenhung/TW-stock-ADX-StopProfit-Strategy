# TW-stock-ADX-StopProfit-Strategy
Trading Strategy Using ADX, Moving Average Crossover, and Bollinger Bands with Trailing Take-Profit
Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of an enhanced ADX trading strategy that integrates a trailing take-profit mechanism. The strategy dynamically adapts to market conditions based on the Average Directional Index (ADX) and utilizes different approaches for trending and ranging markets.

Strategy Logic
1. Trend-Following (Moving Average Crossover) ‚Äì When ADX > 25
If the market is strongly trending, a moving average crossover strategy is used.
A 20-day short-term moving average is compared with a 50-day long-term moving average to generate trading signals:
Buy (+1) when the short MA crosses above the long MA.
Sell (-1) when the short MA crosses below the long MA.

2Ô∏è. Mean Reversion (Bollinger Bands) ‚Äì When ADX < 20
If the market is ranging, a Bollinger Bands mean reversion strategy is applied:
Buy (+1) when the price nears the lower Bollinger Band.
Sell (-1) when the price nears the upper Bollinger Band.
New Feature: Trailing Take-Profit
If the price crosses the middle Bollinger Band, the stop-loss is moved to the midpoint between the entry price and the middle band, locking in potential profits while allowing for further upside.

3Ô∏è. Supports Long and Short Positions
This strategy is designed for futures trading, allowing for both long and short positions.
It computes daily returns and cumulative returns over a 25-year period (2000-2025).

Features
1.Data Source: Fetches Taiwan Stock Index (^TWII) data from Yahoo Finance using yfinance.
2.echnical Indicator Calculations: Implements ADX, Moving Averages, and Bollinger Bands.
3.Dynamic Strategy Selection: Automatically switches between trend-following and mean reversion strategies based on ADX values.
4.railing Take-Profit Mechanism: Uses a dynamic stop-loss update when the price crosses the middle Bollinger Band.
5.Performance Simulation: Computes daily and cumulative returns for strategy evaluation.
6.Visualization: Generates plots showing price movements, technical indicators, trade signals, and cumulative returns.

Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
yfinance

Tek Details:
1. ADX Indicator
The 14-day ADX (Average Directional Index) is used to measure trend strength:
ADX > 25 ‚Üí Trending Market ‚Üí Use Moving Average Crossover Strategy.
ADX < 20 ‚Üí Ranging Market ‚Üí Use Bollinger Bands with Trailing Take-Profit.
2. Moving Average Crossover Strategy
Uses 20-day short-term MA and 50-day long-term MA:
Buy (+1) when short MA crosses above long MA.
Sell (-1) when short MA crosses below long MA.
3. Bollinger Bands with Trailing Take-Profit
Uses Bollinger Bands (20-day moving average ¬± 2 standard deviations):
Buy (+1) when price nears the lower Bollinger Band.
Sell (-1) when price nears the upper Bollinger Band.
If price crosses the middle band, the stop-loss is moved to the midpoint between the entry price and the middle band.
üìå 4. Trading Signal Selection
ADX Indicator	Strategy Used
ADX > 25	Moving Average Crossover
ADX < 20	Bollinger Bands (with trailing take-profit)
20 ‚â§ ADX ‚â§ 25	Hold Previous Position
